//=============================================================================
/**
The ForsimTool enables forward dynamic simulations of joint mechanics to be 
performed. Practically, this allows simulations of cadaver experiments, 
passive clinical examinations, and simulations where the muscle forces or 
excitations are known inputs. 

Fundamentally, this tool is similar to the ForwardTool in the opensim-core,
but the interface is designed to facilitate forward simulations involving 
joint mechanics and specifically articular contact. Additionally, the 
forsim tool uses an implicit integrator (SimTK::CPODES::BDF), which provides 
superior performance for simulations that involve contact compared to the 
explicit integrators used by the existing OpenSim ForwardTool. 

The following optional input input files can be used to define time varying 
simulation parameters:

actuator_input_file: Define muscle and actuator controls (excitations), 
activations, or forces vs time.

external_loads_file: Define the external loads and the model segments
that they are acting on. 

prescribed_coordinate_file: Define the prescribed coordinates in the 
model and their values vs time.
